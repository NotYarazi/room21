# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 22, 2025**

## Overview
Room21 is designed with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains how we handle data in our anonymous chat application.

## Data Collection
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or process any personal information, email addresses, or user accounts.
- **Anonymous Usage**: Users are completely anonymous - no registration or identification required.
- **Local Storage Only**: Chat messages are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to or stored on our servers permanently.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use cookies, analytics, or tracking technologies.

## Data Usage
- **Real-time Communication**: Messages are temporarily processed in server memory only for real-time transmission to other users.
- **No Persistence**: Server-side message data is not stored permanently and is cleared when the server restarts.
- **No Data Sharing**: We do not share, sell, or distribute any data to third parties.

## Technical Information
- **Connection Data**: Only temporary connection information (WebSocket connections) is maintained for real-time functionality.
- **No Logs**: We do not maintain logs of user activities, messages, or connections.
- **HTTPS/WSS**: All communications are encrypted in transit.

## User Rights
- **Complete Control**: Users have complete control over their local data through browser settings.
- **Data Deletion**: Clear your browser's local storage to remove all chat history.
- **Anonymous by Design**: No account deletion needed as no accounts exist.
